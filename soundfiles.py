# I've tried a couple of libs that are capable of playing mp3:
# pysound - offers no way to stop sounds. can't play files with whitespace in path
# pygame  - has problems with certain mp3 files from voice packs
# mpg123 - does not offer volume control. need to be threaded as it's a system binary
#
# ffplay - need to be threaded as it's a system binary. i picked this one as it uses ffmpeg which
#          is an excellent tool and should be installed on any system already
#          I needed some process stuff to be able to stop an already playing sound (kill ffplay subprocess)
